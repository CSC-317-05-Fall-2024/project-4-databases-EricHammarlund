                <h3>Düsseldorf Altstadt</h3>
                <p>The narrow streets of the Altstadt, Düsseldorf’s old town, 
                    are home to chic cocktail bars, cool dance clubs and pubs pouring the 
                    city’s traditional Altbier, which is why locals proclaim that the Altstadt is 
                    the "longest bar in the world". Local eateries serve everything from meaty Rhineland specialties 
                    to sushi and Italian, and the broad promenade along the Rhine is lined with 
                    relaxed cafes. Museums include the Schifffahrtsmuseum, focused on shipping, and 
                    the K20, with modern work by the likes of Klee and Dalí. The Altstadt meets the 
                    Königsalle on one end, and reaches the Rhein (Rhine) and the beautiful 
                    Rheinuferpromenade on the other.</p>

                <h3>Königsallee</h3>
                <p>The Königsallee, literally "King's Avenue" is not 
                    only a grand boulevard, a flagship and a place of longing for international 
                    fashionistas - the Königsallee in Düsseldorf is one of the greatest places 
                    to shop in Europe. Just like jewels in a crown, the elegant flagship stores 
                    all compete to see who glitters the most: Prada, Gucci, Hermès, Chanel, Dior 
                    and Louis Vuitton - anyone who is anyone has a store on the Kö. Adjacent to 
                    Königsallee are the Altstadt, Düsseldorf's old town, and Schadowstraße, 
                    Germany's shopping street with the highest sales revenues.</p>

                <h3>Fortuna Düsseldorf - Merkur Spielarena</h3>
                <p>If you are visiting town during the Bundesliga Season,
                    don't miss a chance at attending a game of the city's football club Fortuna 
                    Düsseldorf. Founded in 1895, Fortuna entered the league in 1913 and was a 
                    fixture in the top flight from the early 1920s up to the creation of the 
                    Bundesliga in 1963. Though 'only' in the 2nd tier of German football (as of 2024), 
                    the team does not lack loyal fans and an incredible atmosphere in- and outside 
                    the stadium. From gathering spots, fan pubs to the team chants and athems, 
                    Düsseldorf's premier team has everything one could be looking for
                    at a sporting event.

                <h3>Eko Haus - Japanese Garden and Temple</h3>
                <p>Düsseldorf has a significant Japanese population, with specific
                    infrastructure built by and for the japanese community. In fact,
                    Düsseldorf is considered to be one of the largest Japanese 
                    communities in Europe. The fact that they brought their way of 
                    life along with their food culture to the Rhine is a great asset 
                    to the city. In 1993, the EKŌ-Haus opened in Düsseldorf's 
                    Niederkassel district. As a religious and cultural centre, it has 
                    a Buddhist temple, Japanese gardens and a traditional Japanese-style 
                    house with a tea room. Would you like to participate in a tea ceremony? 
                    Or be introduced into traditional Japanese arts such as ink painting, 
                    calligraphy or ikebana? Then you are at the right place in the EKŌ-house.

                <h3>Tonhalle Düsseldorf - Concert hall</h3>
                <p>Originally the architect Wilhelm Kreis who had also designed the adjacent 
                    Ehrenhof designed the Tonhalle (formerly Rheinhalle) as a planetarium 
                    in 1925. However, about 50 years after its opening in 1926, the 
                    expressionistic circular building was given a new lease of life: It became 
                    the concert hall, International stars of all genres, from classical to 
                    jazz, from chanson to soul, from piano to cabaret, have since gathered 
                    under the imposing dome. In 2005, the hall was modernised and the acoustics 
                    were improved. Not only the 130 members of the Düsseldorf Symphonic 
                    orchestra enjoy this, for whom the Tonhalle is a musical home, but also the 
                    more than 300,000 culture fans, who visit the 450 events every year.

                <h3>Kö-Bogen</h3>
                <p>The architecture in Düsseldorf is well stocked with big names - including 
                    Daniel Libeskind. The New Yorker designed a building ensemble with a convex 
                    and concave curved façade for the newly designed square at the upper end of 
                    the Königsallee. Glass and travertine, a bright natural stone, characterise 
                    the exterior of the five-storey building. The façade is brought to life by 
                    the masterful interaction of materials and the slanted, green niches. Since 
                    its opening in autumn 2013, the Kö-Bogen is an exclusive part of the 
                    Düsseldorf shopping scene. The Breuninger department store, Porsche Design, 
                    the Apple Store - they are all here next to each other.  </p>

                <h3>Schloss Benrath</h3>
                <p>The pleasure palace in the countryside. Twelve kilometres from the city's 
                    former gates, Elector Karl Theodor von der Pfalz had a maison de plaisance 
                    built by Nicolas de Pigage from 1756 to 1773 with generous gardens. But the 
                    Elector visited the estate only once in his lifetime. Today, however, it 
                    does not suffer from a lack of visitors. Both Benrath Palace and the 61 
                    hectare park are popular attractions in the south of Düsseldorf. The garden 
                    is equally popular with art and nature lovers: The park is home to more than 
                    80 species of birds and over 300 species of beetles. Rare North American 
                    shrubs characterise the so-called Kurfürstengarten (Elector’s garden), which 
                    was created by outstanding garden artists such as Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe 
                    and Peter Joseph Lenné in the 19th century. </p>

                <h3>boot Düsseldorf</h3>
                <p>The Düsseldorf International Boat Show (German: Internationale Bootsausstellung Düsseldorf), 
                    more commonly known as boot Düsseldorf or just boot is one of the world's 
                    premier boat shows. With some 1,600 exhibitors from over 50 countries, boot 
                    Düsseldorf is considered a benchmark for the international boat and water sports 
                    industry. Unparalleled at other major boat shows, large vessels up to 180 grt can 
                    be looked on in their entirety, as the exhibition is a complete indoor event. 
                    Boot Düsseldorf is held annually at Messe Düsseldorf, Germany, for the duration 
                    of a week in the end of January.</p>

                <h3>Kaiserswerth & the Kaiserpfalz, Imperial Palace</h3>
                <p>The Kaiserswerth district in the north of Düsseldorf is a small, historic world 
                    in itself. Built around the Kaiserpfalz, a gigantic building, erected by emperor 
                    Frederick I Barbarossa around 1184, the imposing ruins of the Palace still 
                    characterise the cityscape of Kaiserswerth today as a monument to the past.
                    Besides the Kaiserpfalz, Kaiserwerth has plenty to offer: In the town centre, 
                    pretty Baroque houses from the 17th and 18th centuries are just waiting to be admired. 
                    Also worth seeing: the St. Suitbertus Basilika in the Stiftsplatz, a Romanesque 
                    pillar basilica, where the remains of Saint Suitbertus rest in a gilded shrine. 
                    Kaiserswerth is not only culturally but also gastronomically well established in 
                    premier class: The star restaurant “Im Schiffchen” at the Kaiserswerther market is 
                    considered one of the best in the city.</p>
